## The idea behind the project

- This project uses [Vite.js](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
It includes `@mui/material` with `@mui/icons-material` and their peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v5.

- This project is a rewrite for [Nofated095/nofated.win](https://github.com/Nofated095/nofated.win). Although it used to have a shit and large HTML & CSS & JS code with a low performance on browser, but the design is disreable so that the nof.moe is still using the style.
